## Overview

The **kubectl-go-mcp-server** is designed to enhance the security of Kubernetes interactions via kubectl commands. It provides a robust framework for AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot, to safely interact with Kubernetes clusters. By implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), this server ensures that all commands undergo thorough validation and security checks before execution.

## Features

- **Secure Interactions**: Validates kubectl commands to prevent unauthorized access and actions.
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Allows AI tools to interact with Kubernetes safely.
- **Robust Validation**: Implements strict checks on commands to ensure compliance with security protocols.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple installation process to get you up and running quickly.
- **Community Driven**: Open-source project with contributions welcomed from developers.

## Usage

After setting up the server, you can begin using it with kubectl commands. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Start the MCP Server**:
   Ensure that the server is running. You should see a confirmation message in your terminal.

2. **Use kubectl with MCP**:
   When you run a kubectl command, the MCP server will validate it before execution. For example:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   The server will check the command against its validation rules.

3. **Integrate with AI Assistants**:
   If you are using GitHub Copilot or similar tools, they can suggest commands. The MCP server will ensure these commands are secure before they run.
